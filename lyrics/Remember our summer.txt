Lately I wanna stay awake
I don't want the days to end
I know you'll fly away
Need to hold you for myself
I feel the time run through my hands
Try to grab it but it fades
Say "goodbye" in all the possible ways
I don't want you to get lost
Will we ever meet again?
I'll anesthetize the pain
Please remember our summers
My heart is closed by duel
Will I learn to love again?
Who will walk with me in the rain?
Please remember our summers
Come the sun,
Come the rain
And the leaves falling
I will wait even if the seasons change
Anxiety runs through my veins
I'll escape from all these chains
Say "come back", in all the possible ways
I don't want you to get lost
Will we ever meet again?
I'll anesthetize the pain
Please remember our summers
My heart is closed by duel
Will I learn to love again?
Who will walk with me in the rain?
Please remember our summers
