Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do, but try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

[Justin Bieber:]
You've been in a mood 
You've been givin' hella attitude
What I gotta do to get through to ya?
I could never lose you
Maybe spend a night out on the town like we used to
We could sit around, watch funny shit on YouTube
I know at times I can have a couple screws loose
I'm tryna connect to your body, girl, like it's Bluetooth
You know what I mean, you know what I need

[iann dior:]
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We been here before and I won't be your victim

Yeah, I got J.B. and J.B., you know the bitches goin' crazy
Number one song in the world, so now she wanna date me
Where I'm from, people like me don't make it in the mainstream
What's with the attitude? Baby, tell me why you hating
We fuss and fight, you get into moods
Argue all night, what we supposed to do?
Can't make things right, so I'm on the move
Guess it's safe to say

[J Balvin:]
(Latino gang, J Balvin, man)
Baby, ya estoy cansado de tu bipolaridad, yah-yah-yeh
Deja ya de estar peleando sin una necesidad
Valórame, bebé, yo
Con ese humor nadie te aguantará
¿Quién te entiende? Si conmigo no te falta na'
Cógela suave, ma', porque esta bomba explotará
Si te saco el genio no vuelvo a frotar tu lámpara
Ay, listo, te dejé en visto
Pero fue porque estaba grabando mi disco
Y tú pensando que yo estaba en la disco
Deja de pelear, que la pasemos más rico
